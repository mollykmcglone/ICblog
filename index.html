  <p>Hello reader, and thank you for visiting my blog.  Let me start by assuring you that I know it's a little late to get into blogging. I'm aware of the fact that most of the world has moved on to Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram, where instead of long meandering blog postings you can easily consume 140 character soundbytes or simply float through image after image of kittens behaving badly. I confess that I am rather a late-bloomer,    however, and so am kicking off my "online presence", as the kids say, with this site.  Of course I will try to keep my dispatches relatively brief, in recognition that your attention-span is under constant attack from the dark side.  I hope that this medium will help me channel my creative energy and connect with a few like-minded living creatures along the way.  And so, let us begin!</p>
