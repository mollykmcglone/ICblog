      <h2>My Famous Human</h2>
      <p>Was reading an article in our local paper this morning when all of a sudden I had a strong sense of deja vu.  Wait a minute, I thought- this study being referenced sounds an awful lot like what Erik has been going on and on about when I ask him how his day went at work.  And sure enough, I clicked a source link in the story and found myself staring at <a href="http://public.health.oregon.gov/PreventionWellness/marijuana/Documents/oha-8509-marijuana-report.pdf">a report he helped write</a>.  Of course I'm happy for Erik but I just hope this newfound fame doesn't go to his head... and that we won't be mobbed by paparazzi at the park.<br><br><span class="date">January 22nd, 2016</span></p>

      <h2>Lucky Day</h2>
      <p>Every couple weeks one of my humans and I go for a walk over to the Belmont branch of the Multnomah County Library. It's a very pleasant fifteen-minute walk over there, and there have a decent area outside where I can hang out and wait for them without dealing with too much traffic noise.  But the best part is when they score a book or two from the "Lucky Day" shelf at the library-they get so happy! Lucky Day books are new releases that are kept separate from the normal library checkout processes.  Nobody can place a hold on them, and they can't be renewed.  If you happen to find one you only get to keep it for two weeks.  That timeframe can sometimes be a challenge for the humans, but of course my schedule is pretty open so I'm always glad for a Lucky Day book or two in the house.  Anyhow, the other day Erik got luck and brought home, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Between_the_World_and_Me">Between the World and Me</a>. Man, what a read. I'm still putting my thoughts together, but I can say that I learned facts I should have known before, cried, got angry, and developed a deeper understanding of race and privilege/oppression in this country.  <em>Rating=Fierce tail wagging.</em><br><br><span class="date">January 21st, 2016</span></p>

      <h2>Sleeping Tapes</h2>
      <p>Last night my humans listened to a new album of tracks designed to help them sleep, created by a guy named Jeff Bridges. Persononally I've never had an issue drifting off to sleep and do so about 14 times daily.  That said, it's definitely relaxing and some of the lyrics made me chuckle.  For example, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtmbzuZj1R8">Feeling Good</a> is basically a long list of affirmations ranging from old standards like "you belong" to more inventive choices like "you order well at restaurants". <em>Rating= 2 paws up.</em><br><br><span class="date">January 20th, 2016</span></p>

      <h2>State of the Union</h2>
      <p>Just a brief shout-out after President Obama's last State of the Union address.  Job well done, sir! And I love this photo!<br><br> <img src="img/Obama.png" alt="President Obama adjusting his collar"><br><br><span class="date">January 12th, 2016</span></p>

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>Hello reader, and thanks for visiting my blog! Let me start by assuring you that I know it's a little late to get into blogging. I'm aware that most of the world has moved on to Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram, where instead of long meandering blog postings you can easily consume 140-character soundbytes or simply float through image after image of kittens behaving badly. I confess that I'm rather a late-bloomer, however, and so am kicking off my "online presence", as the kids say, with this site.  Of course I'll try to keep my dispatches brief, in recognition that your attention-span is under constant attack from the dark side.  I hope this project will help me channel my creative energy and connect with a few like-minded creatures along the way.<br><br><span class="date">January 11th, 2016</span></p>
